# Machine Learning Models Repository

Welcome to the Machine Learning Models Repository! This repository contains implementations of various machine learning models along with accompanying documentation and examples.

## Introduction

Machine learning is a rapidly evolving field with a wide range of algorithms and techniques. This repository aims to provide a comprehensive collection of popular machine learning models implemented in Python, along with clear documentation and usage examples.

## Usage

Each model is implemented as a separate Python module with a consistent interface. Here's a general outline of how to use the models:

1. **Import the Model**: Import the desired model class from the corresponding module.
2. **Instantiate the Model**: Create an instance of the model class, optionally passing any required parameters.
3. **Train the Model**: Train the model on your dataset using the `fit()` method.
4. **Predictions**: Use the trained model to make predictions on new data using the `predict()` method.

## Models Included

This repository includes implementations of the following machine learning models:

1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
3. Decision Trees
4. Random Forests
5. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
6. k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
7. Naive Bayes
8. Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)
9. Neural Networks
10. Clustering Algorithms (e.g., K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering)

Each model is documented with explanations of its underlying principles, implementation details, and usage examples.
