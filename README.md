## Models Included

This repository includes implementations of the following machine learning models:

1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
3. Decision Trees
4. Random Forests
5. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
6. k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
7. Naive Bayes
8. Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)
9. Neural Networks
10. Clustering Algorithms (e.g., K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering)

Each model is documented with explanations of its underlying principles, implementation details, and usage examples.
